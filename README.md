## Developed Google colab workbooks for functions in Python

Here you can find workbooks developed for applying specific functions applied in Python.

* Cleaning SMILES
* Calculating Mordred descriptors

## When you are developing a function...

* use lowercase letters and underscores for function names and variables (except for names such as SIRIUS, etc., or using one variable to calculate other(s) such as "SMILES2descriptors").
* check if the same variables are used in other functions; if yes, then keep to the same writing of the variable.
* specify variable types for inputs if possible.
* note down which libraries does your function depend on.
